## ðŸŽ¯ Research Objectives & Results

**Research triggered by**: Following RD-001's [[EB Teaching Guide for Phonics and Reading to Bilingual Children in HK]] establishment of synthetic phonics methodology, specific word lists and flashcard materials were needed. The gap identified was lack of concrete, sequenced vocabulary lists adapted for Cantonese L1 interference patterns.

| Objective | Success Criteria | Result | Evidence |
| --------- | --------------- | ------ | -------- |
| Analyse established program word lists | Compare 2-3 major programs | âœ… Achieved | Jolly Phonics, Letters & Sounds, ORT sequences documented |
| Find ESL-specific sight word sequences | Identify validated ESL progressions | âœ… Achieved | New Dolch List (NDL) - 90% text coverage vs 70% traditional |
| Define book-phonics matching criteria | Clear decodability percentages | âœ… Achieved | 80-90% decodability standard, 93-97% reading accuracy target |
| Locate HK/Cantonese-specific materials | Find validated local adaptations | âœ… Achieved | PLP-R, Space Town programmes, local publisher adaptations |

## ðŸ’¡ Key Findings for Implementation

1. **Word progressions converge**: All major programs start with SATPIN, then diverge slightly - Jolly Phonics uses 7 groups, Letters & Sounds has 6 phases with 69+ words by Phase 2
2. **New Dolch List superior for ESL**: 875 words provide 90% text coverage (vs 70% for traditional Dolch) from modern corpus including YouTube content
3. **80-90% decodability optimal**: Below 80% frustrates learners, above 90% unnecessary - transition to regular texts by end Grade 1
4. **HK materials address specific needs**: Local programs target absent phonemes (/v/, /z/, /Î¸/, /Ã°/, /r/) and consonant cluster difficulties systematically

## ðŸ“‹ Next Actions Required

- [ ] Create flashcard sets: 26 single letters â†’ 50-60 CVC by vowel â†’ digraphs â†’ blends (20-30 words per pattern)
- [ ] Develop Cantonese interference word lists: /v/ practice (valuable, cave), /z/ practice (freezer, cosy), clusters (street, proud)
- [ ] Build spaced repetition tracking system: Day 1, 2, 4, 11, 25 review schedule
- [ ] Design assessment checkpoints: 93-97% accuracy threshold for progression decisions
- [ ] Create parent guides showing NDL word progression with Hong Kong contexts

# Creating effective phonics flashcards for Cantonese-speaking children requires specific word lists, careful progression planning, and targeted adaptations for L1 interference patterns. This research provides concrete word lists from established programs and Hong Kong-specific implementation strategies.

## Established program word lists reveal core progressions

Three major phonics programs dominate English literacy instruction, each with distinct approaches but significant overlap in core vocabulary. **Jolly Phonics** organizes instruction into seven letter-sound groups, beginning with s, a, t, i, p, n and progressing through increasingly complex patterns (Primarily Learning, 2024; Playloft, 2024; Bambinos, 2024). Their tricky words follow a color-coded system: Red Level introduces *I, the, he, she, me, we, be, was, to, do, of*, while subsequent levels add words like *said, come, some, here, there* (Yellow) and *who, where, why, what, when* (Green) (Jolly Learning UK, 2024; Jolly Learning US, 2024).

**Letters and Sounds**, the UK government's systematic phonics program, provides the most detailed word progressions across six phases (Oxford Owl, 2024a; Phonics Family, 2024). Phase 2 begins with just 7 possible words from the first four letters (s, a, t, p): *at, sat, pat, tap*. By the end of Phase 2, students can decode 69+ words using basic letter sounds (EnglishBix, 2024; Letters-and-Sounds.com, 2024). Phase 3 introduces consonant digraphs (*chip, shop, thin, ring*) and vowel digraphs with extensive word lists: **ai** words include *rain, tail, chain, brain, train*, while **ee** words cover *bee, tree, sheep, sleep, street, queen, wheel* (Grange Primary School, 2024; FileWiz, 2024).

**Oxford Reading Tree** integrates phonics within leveled readers, starting with single CVC words at Level 1+ and progressing to complex vowel patterns by Level 5 (Oxford Owl, 2024b; Oxford Reading Buddy Support, 2024). Their sight word progression follows reading levels: Stages 1-2 introduce *a, and, go, I, in, is, it, no, of, the, to, up*, while Stages 3-5 add essential verbs and pronouns (Tes, 2024).

Reading Eggs Fast Phonics provides an alternative systematic sequence across 20 peaks, beginning with single letters and progressing through increasingly complex patterns (Reading Eggs, 2024).

## ESL-specific sight words require different approaches

The **New Dolch List (NDL)**, specifically created for ESL learners, contains 875 words providing 90% coverage of children's texts - significantly higher than the original Dolch list's 70% coverage at the same word count (New General Service List Project, 2024a, 2024b). This list draws from a 2.5-million-word corpus including children's graded readers, EFL textbooks, and popular YouTube content, making it particularly relevant for modern learners (Cambridge Centre, 2024).

Research reveals that **only 2-4% of English words are truly irregular**, challenging traditional sight word teaching (Simply Kinder, 2024; Reading Rockets, 2024a). Words can be categorized as Flash Words (decodable with known patterns), Heart Words (containing irregular parts), or Temporarily Irregular (following patterns not yet taught) (Informed Literacy, 2024a). For example, in the word "said," the /s/ and /d/ follow regular patterns, but the "ai" = /e/ sound must be memorized "by heart" (NWEA, 2023).

For ESL contexts, the **Fry List proves superior to Dolch** due to its recency (1980 vs. 1936), inclusion of all parts of speech, and extension to 1000 words allowing progressive skill building (SpellQuiz, 2024; Sight Words, 2024; The Curriculum Corner, 2024). ESL-specific progressions prioritize survival vocabulary first (I, you, want, have, help), then expand through contextual, meaningful phrases rather than isolated word memorization (Keys to Literacy, 2024).

## Book-phonics matching requires specific decodability percentages

While research shows no universal decodability percentage, **80-90% decodability emerges as the practical standard** for effective phonics practice (Busy Bee Kindergarten, 2024; Shanahan on Literacy, 2024a). Publishers like Pearson Bug Club and Oxford claim 100% decodability in their phonics readers, achieved through careful alignment with teaching sequences and minimal use of irregular words (Pearson, 2024a, 2024b; Peters, 2024).

Assessment criteria focus on five key elements: texts must be instructive (majority decodable), comprehensible (grammatically correct), engaging (worthwhile content), sequential (building knowledge gradually), and cumulative (reinforcing previous skills) (Reading Universe, 2024a). The **93-97% accuracy target** for student reading ensures optimal growth - below this suggests the text is too difficult, above indicates insufficient challenge (NWEA, 2024).

Transition from decodable to regular texts occurs individually but typically happens by end of Grade 1 for most students (Shanahan on Literacy, 2024b). The progression follows a pattern: 95%+ decodability for beginners, 85-90% for transitional readers, then gradual decrease as sight vocabulary develops to "several thousand words" (Reading Universe, 2024b, 2024c).

Oxford Reading Tree's Floppy's Phonics Decoding Practice series demonstrates practical implementation, starting with s, a, t, p words and phrases at Level 1+ (Amazon, 2024a).

## Hong Kong materials address specific Cantonese interference

The Hong Kong Education Bureau provides comprehensive phonics support through programs like **Primary Literacy Programme - Reading (PLP-R)** and the enhanced **Space Town Literacy Programme** (HKEdCity, 2024a, 2024b). These incorporate earlier phonics introduction and multimodal learning specifically designed for local contexts (EdCity, 2024; Global English, 2024).

Critical pronunciation challenges for Cantonese speakers require targeted intervention (British Accent Academy, 2024; ResearchGate, 2024; Taylor & Francis Online, 2024). **Consonant issues** include final consonant deletion (Cantonese allows only 6 final consonants), consonant cluster difficulties (inserting vowels in words like "street"), and absent sounds in Cantonese (/v/, /z/, /Î¸/, /Ã°/, /r/). Word lists must specifically practice these problem areas:
- **/v/ practice**: valuable, cave, vacation, level, hive
- **/z/ practice**: freezer, cosy, buys, reasons, prize  
- **/Î¸/ practice**: think, bath, everything, truth, thumb
- **Consonant clusters**: proud, smooth, breeze, string, straw
- **Final consonants**: bird, prizes, grab, laugh, taxes

Local publishers have adapted materials accordingly. **Pearson Longman Hong Kong's New Phonics for Kids** uses multi-sensory approaches compatible with audio pens (Pearson, 2024c), while **Oxford Story Phonics** employs an onset-rhyme approach specifically suited to Cantonese learners' syllable awareness (OUP China, 2024).

## Practical implementation maximizes learning efficiency

Effective flashcard sets follow age-appropriate sizing: 10-15 cards for ages 3-4, expanding to 30-50 cards for ages 6+ (Amazon, 2024b). Beginning phonics typically uses **20-30 words per phonics pattern**, starting with 26 single-letter sound cards and progressing to 50-60 CVC words organized by vowel sound.

The optimal **decodable to sight word ratio begins at 80-90% decodable** for early learners, gradually shifting to 70:30 as vocabulary expands. Daily practice should follow spaced repetition: introduce on Day 1, review on Days 2, 4, 11, and 25 for optimal retention (Wikipedia, 2024; Third Space Learning, 2024). Sessions should last 5-10 minutes with a maximum of 30 cards reviewed.

Word progression follows a systematic sequence (Phonics.org, 2024; Surrey Schools One, 2024; Mrs Wordsmith, 2024):
1. **CVC words** (cat, bed, pig, dog, sun)
2. **CVCC/CCVC blends** (jump, trip, stop, plan)
3. **Digraphs** (ship, that, bath, ring)
4. **Vowel teams** (rain, feet, boat, blue)
5. **R-controlled vowels** (car, bird, corn)
6. **Multisyllabic words** (rabbit, elephant)

For Cantonese speakers, implementation requires specific adaptations: slower introduction pace (2-3 sounds weekly), increased repetition (7-10 exposures per card), multisensory techniques emphasizing problem sounds, and cultural bridging using familiar Hong Kong contexts (South China Morning Post, 2024; Life Skills Advocate, 2024; ResearchGate, 2024). Mirror work helps with sounds absent in Cantonese, while "whisper phones" amplify students' own voices for self-monitoring pronunciation (Lucky Little Learners, 2024).

The New Dolch List specifically addresses ESL learners' needs, providing significantly higher text coverage than traditional lists when used with young learners (New General Service List Project, 2024a, 2024b; Cambridge Centre, 2024).

## Conclusion

Creating effective phonics flashcards for Hong Kong's Cantonese-speaking children requires combining established program word lists with ESL-specific progressions and local adaptations. The New Dolch List provides optimal vocabulary coverage for L2 learners, while maintaining 80-90% decodability ensures appropriate challenge levels. Most critically, materials must systematically address Cantonese L1 interference patterns through targeted practice of absent sounds and different syllable structures. Success depends on consistent implementation using spaced repetition, multisensory techniques, and progression from simple CVC patterns through complex multisyllabic words, always maintaining meaningful context relevant to Hong Kong learners' experiences.
