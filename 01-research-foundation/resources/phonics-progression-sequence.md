## ðŸ“Š Assessment & Review Protocol

### Daily Review (5 minutes)
- Previous day's pattern
- Mixed review of week's learning
- Quick fluency check

### Weekly Assessment (15 minutes)
- All patterns from current week
- Maintenance check of previous 2 weeks
- Encoding (spelling) assessment
- Connected text reading

### Monthly Comprehensive (30 minutes)
- All patterns taught to date
- Fluency benchmarks
- Comprehension with decodable text
- Identify gaps for reteaching

### Progression Decision Points
**Advance when ALL criteria met**:
1. âœ… 90% accuracy over 3 sessions
2. âœ… Fluency (automatic, not laboured)
3. âœ… Application in connected text
4. âœ… 75%+ encoding accuracy
5. âœ… Maintenance of previous skills

**If criteria not met**:
- Continue current group 1-2 weeks
- Increase review frequency
- Adjust teaching approach
- Consider individual factors

## ðŸŽŒ Cantonese L1 Adaptations

### Critical Interference Points
1. **Missing phonemes**: /v/, /z/, /Î¸/, /Ã°/, /r/ - require explicit articulation
2. **Final consonants**: Often dropped in Cantonese - emphasise CVC endings
3. **Consonant clusters**: Non-existent in Cantonese - extended blend practice
4. **Vowel length**: Not phonemic in Cantonese - teach short/long distinction

### Pacing Adjustments
- 2-3 letters/week vs 4-5 (native speakers)
- 2-3 weeks on alphabetic principle
- Double practice for problem sounds
- Weekly AND monthly review cycles
- L1 mediation for difficult concepts

   - Phase 1: 70-80% decodable texts
   - Phase 2-3: 60-70% decodable texts  
   - Phase 4-5: 40-50% decodable texts

2. **High-frequency words**:
   - 1-6 new words weekly
   - Integrate with phonics (Heart Words approach)
   - Identify decodable portions

3. **Lesson structure** (30 minutes):
   - 5 min: Review
   - 5 min: Phonological awareness
   - 10 min: Decoding practice
   - 5 min: Encoding practice
   - 5 min: Connected text

4. **Materials needed per phase**:
   - Flashcards for each pattern
   - Decodable books at appropriate level
   - Word lists for practice
