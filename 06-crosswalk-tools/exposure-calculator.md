# Exposure Calculator

## Calculating English Exposure Hours for Learning Targets

### Purpose
This tool helps estimate the amount of English exposure needed for a Cantonese-speaking child to reach specific milestones in their literacy journey.

## Quick Reference Formula

**Total Hours Needed = Base Hours × Exposure Modifier × Individual Factor**

### Base Hours by Milestone

| Milestone | Minimal Exposure Base | Regular Exposure Base | High Exposure Base |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| First 10 letters | 100 hours | 60 hours | 30 hours |
| All 26 letters | 300 hours | 180 hours | 100 hours |
| Letter-sound mastery | 500 hours | 300 hours | 180 hours |
| CVC reading | 800 hours | 500 hours | 300 hours |
| Basic phonics fluency | 1200 hours | 800 hours | 500 hours |

## Exposure Quality Ratings

### High-Quality Exposure (1.0 multiplier)
- Direct instruction with trained teacher
- One-on-one or small group (2-3 children)
- Multi-sensory activities
- Immediate feedback
- **Examples**: Tutoring, quality phonics class

### Medium-Quality Exposure (1.5 multiplier)
- Structured activities with parent/teacher
- Larger group (4-8 children)
- Some interaction
- Regular feedback
- **Examples**: Kindergarten English, parent reading time

### Low-Quality Exposure (2.0 multiplier)
- Passive exposure
- Large group or media
- Limited interaction
- Minimal feedback
- **Examples**: TV shows, apps, background English

## Daily Exposure Calculations

### Scenario A: Minimal Home Exposure
```
School English: 30 min/day × 5 days = 2.5 hrs/week (medium quality)
Home English: 10 min/day × 7 days = 1.2 hrs/week (low quality)
Weekly total: 2.5 + (1.2 × 2) = 4.9 hours effective exposure
Annual total: 4.9 × 40 weeks = 196 hours
```
**Timeline to CVC reading**: ~4 years

### Scenario B: Regular Exposure
```
School English: 45 min/day × 5 days = 3.75 hrs/week (medium quality)
Home practice: 15 min/day × 5 days = 1.25 hrs/week (high quality)
English media: 30 min/day × 7 days = 3.5 hrs/week (low quality)
Weekly total: 3.75 + 1.25 + (3.5 × 2) = 12 hours effective
Annual total: 12 × 45 weeks = 540 hours
```
**Timeline to CVC reading**: ~1 year

### Scenario C: High Exposure
```
School English: 2 hrs/day × 5 days = 10 hrs/week (medium quality)
Home practice: 20 min/day × 7 days = 2.3 hrs/week (high quality)
English conversation: 30 min/day × 7 days = 3.5 hrs/week (high quality)
Weekly total: 10 + 2.3 + 3.5 = 15.8 hours effective
Annual total: 15.8 × 45 weeks = 711 hours
```
**Timeline to CVC reading**: 8-10 months

## Individual Factors

### Accelerating Factors (0.8 multiplier)
- Strong L1 literacy
- High motivation
- Good phonological awareness
- Previous language learning
- Regular practice
- Supportive environment

### Neutral Factors (1.0 multiplier)
- Age-appropriate development
- Average motivation
- Typical phonological skills
- First foreign language
- Intermittent practice

### Decelerating Factors (1.3 multiplier)
- Language processing difficulties
- Low motivation
- Weak phonological awareness
- Limited L1 vocabulary
- Irregular practice
- Minimal support

## Practical Planning Tool

### Step 1: Current Exposure Audit
Track for one typical week:

| Activity | Minutes/Day | Days/Week | Quality | Weekly Hours |
|----------|------------|-----------|---------|--------------|
| School English | ___ | ___ | H/M/L | ___ |
| Parent reading | ___ | ___ | H/M/L | ___ |
| English media | ___ | ___ | H/M/L | ___ |
| English play | ___ | ___ | H/M/L | ___ |
| Other: ___ | ___ | ___ | H/M/L | ___ |

**Total Effective Hours/Week**: ___

### Step 2: Goal Setting
Select target milestone:
- [ ] First 10 letters (100-300 hours)
- [ ] All letters (180-500 hours)
- [ ] CVC reading (300-800 hours)
- [ ] Phonics fluency (500-1200 hours)

### Step 3: Timeline Calculation
```
Weeks needed = Total hours needed ÷ Weekly effective hours
Months needed = Weeks needed ÷ 4
```

### Step 4: Optimisation Strategies

**To increase effective exposure without adding time:**
- Convert low-quality to medium-quality (add interaction)
- Convert medium-quality to high-quality (reduce group size)
- Add structure to passive activities
- Increase parent involvement
- Use spaced repetition

**To accelerate progress:**
- Add 10 minutes high-quality daily practice
- Replace 30 minutes passive media with interactive apps
- Join small group phonics class
- Implement consistent bedtime reading
- Create English-rich environment zones

## Research-Based Ratios

### Optimal Weekly Distribution
- 40% Direct instruction (high-quality)
- 30% Guided practice (medium-quality)
- 30% Incidental exposure (low-quality)

### Minimum Effective Dose
- Pre-literacy: 3 hours/week effective exposure
- Alphabet: 5 hours/week effective exposure
- Transition: 7 hours/week effective exposure
- Phonics: 10 hours/week effective exposure

## Exposure Enhancement Strategies

### For Minimal Exposure Families
1. Start with 10 minutes daily high-quality practice
2. Use [[memory://02-pre-literacy/02.4-parent-guide]] for L1 support
3. Focus on consistency over quantity
4. Gradually increase as comfort grows

### For Regular Exposure Families
1. Optimise existing exposure quality
2. Add structured home practice
3. Use [[memory://06-crosswalk-tools/materials-by-need]] efficiently
4. Track progress weekly

### For High Exposure Families
1. Ensure quality matches quantity
2. Prevent overwhelm with variety
3. Include consolidation time
4. Monitor for appropriate challenge

## Common Misconceptions

**"More is always better"**
- Quality matters more than quantity
- Overwhelm can slow progress
- Rest and consolidation essential

**"Passive exposure counts fully"**
- Passive exposure helps but isn't sufficient
- Interactive exposure is 2-3x more effective
- Direct instruction irreplaceable

**"Native speakers don't need calculation"**
- Even L1 speakers need 1000+ hours for literacy
- Bilingual children need structured support
- Exposure calculation helps set realistic expectations

## Using This Calculator

1. **Assess** current exposure realistically
2. **Calculate** effective hours using quality multipliers
3. **Project** timeline to goals
4. **Optimise** exposure quality and quantity
5. **Monitor** progress against projections
6. **Adjust** based on individual factors
