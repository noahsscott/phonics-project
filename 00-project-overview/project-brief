> [!abstract] Project Overview
> | **Project Name**    | Phonics and Flashcards Project |
> |--------------------|---------------------------------|
> | **Status**         | ðŸš€ Materials Development (Pre-Phonics Focus) |
> | **Learning Journey** | 6-stage progression: Pre-literacy â†’ Alphabet â†’ Transition â†’ Phonics â†’ Complex â†’ Crosswalk |
> | **Target Audience** | Bilingual children (3-8) in Hong Kong |
> | **Key Discovery**   | Children need 6-20 weeks pre-phonics before letters (RD-004) |

**Project Evolution**: Originally designed to teach phonics through flashcards, we discovered most target children don't know letters yet. Research (RD-004 to RD-006) revealed children need 6-20 weeks of oral phonological awareness before introducing letters. We've pivoted to create a complete learning journey from pre-literacy through phonics, with materials specifically addressing Cantonese L1 challenges. Currently developing assessment tools and pre-phonics materials for pilot testing with 2 students.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

**Evidence-based goals** (from RD-001 to RD-006):
1. **Pre-phonics foundation**: Develop 15-30 min daily PA activities for children without letter knowledge (6-20 week programme)
2. **Complete learning pathway**: Materials for Pre-literacy â†’ Alphabet (15-20 letter threshold) â†’ SATPIN phonics (90% mastery criterion)
3. **Cantonese-specific support**: Target L1 challenges - missing phonemes (/v/, /z/, /Î¸/, /Ã°/, /r/), no consonant clusters, 6 final consonants only
4. **Assessment-driven progression**: Track 5 exposures per stage, advance at 90% accuracy over 3 sessions

## ðŸ‘¥ Target Learners

**Hong Kong bilingual children (3-8 years)**: Cantonese L1, varying English exposure, one-on-one home tutoring (60-90 min sessions).

**Critical L1 challenges**: Missing English phonemes (/v/ â†’ /f/, /z/ â†’ /s/, /Î¸/ â†’ /f/, /r/ â†’ /l/), no consonant clusters ("stop" â†’ "sÉ™top"), unreleased final consonants ("cat" â†’ "ca").

**L1 advantages to leverage**: Superior tone awareness transfers to English stress patterns, strong existing syllable processing (McBride-Chang, 2015).

## ðŸŽ­ Differentiated Pathways

**Student profiles from research** (validated in RD-004 to RD-006):

**By starting point**:
- **No English exposure** (3-4 years): Full journey - 20 weeks pre-literacy â†’ alphabet â†’ phonics
- **Some exposure** (4-6 years): Start at alphabet if 50+ English words known, otherwise pre-literacy
- **High exposure/older** (6+ years): Assess for 15-letter threshold, potentially skip to transition/phonics

**By learning needs**:
- **Typical progression**: 5 exposures per stage, advance at 90% mastery
- **Additional support needed**: 7+ exposures, multisensory materials (sand trays, mirrors for /Î¸/ sounds)
- **Cantonese L1 challenges**: Extra practice on missing phonemes, final consonant retention exercises

**Placement tool**: Student placement guide to match learners to appropriate starting point (planned)

## ðŸŽ“ Teaching Implementation

**Session Structure** (RD-001 evidence):
- **60 minutes**: 24min new content â†’ 12min practice â†’ 18min application (primacy-recency effect)
- **90 minutes**: Two 40-min learning episodes with 10-15 min active break
- **Materials**: Flashcards (3"Ã—5", black on white, no pictures), decodable texts (80% decodability initially), manipulatives for PA

**Exposure-Based Progression** (not time-based):
- **Tracking system**: Count exposures (teaching instances), not weeks or days
- **Flexible for varied schedules**: Students attending 1x/week vs 2x/week reach same mastery
- **Research backing**: 90% accuracy over 3 consecutive sessions ensures automatisation (RD-003, Wilson Reading System 2024)
- **Parent communication**: Explain exposure-based vs traditional week-based expectations

**Validated Progression**:
- **Pre-phonics**: 6-20 weeks oral PA activities without letters
- **Alphabet**: Embedded mnemonics, 15-20 letters minimum before phonics (RD-006)
- **Phonics**: SATPIN (2-3 weeks) â†’ Groups 1.2-1.3 â†’ Blends â†’ Digraphs
- **Mastery criterion**: 90% accuracy over 3 consecutive sessions before advancing

## ðŸ“Š Success Benchmarks

**Research-validated metrics**:
- **PA readiness**: Syllable segmentation + rhyme recognition + initial sound isolation before letters (RD-004)
- **Letter threshold**: 15-20 letters with <2 second automaticity before phonics (RD-006)  
- **Progression**: 90% accuracy over 3 sessions at each stage (RD-003)
- **Word coverage**: 315 words = 78% text coverage; 875 words = 90% coverage (NDL 1.1)

## ðŸš€ Current Phase: Materials Development

### Research Complete (6 documents)
- âœ… **RD-001 to RD-003**: Methodology established - synthetic phonics (60%), analytic (30%), embedded (10%)
- âœ… **RD-004 to RD-006**: Pre-phonics gap identified and addressed
- âœ… **Key finding**: 95% can learn to read with systematic instruction vs 30% without (Lexia, 2024)

### Materials in Development
- ðŸ”„ **MAT-001**: Phonics readiness assessment checklist
- ðŸ”„ **MAT-003 to MAT-005**: Bridge activity programme (12-20 weeks)
- ðŸ”„ **MAT-006**: SATPIN flashcards with embedded mnemonics
- ðŸ”„ **Progress tracking**: 5-exposure system per stage (not week-based)
- ðŸ”„ **Crosswalk tools**: Materials-by-need finder, student placement guide (planned)

### Next Milestone
**Pilot testing**: 2 students (1x/week vs 2x/week schedules), validate 90% mastery criterion, document exposure patterns

## ðŸ’¾ Technical Approach

**Data structure**: JSON format for word lists, patterns, and L1 challenges. Currently implemented for SATPIN (36 words + 10 nonsense). Format designed for future compatibility with phonics flashcard generator tool.

**Assessment tools**: Stage-based tracking (not week-based) to accommodate varied attendance patterns.
