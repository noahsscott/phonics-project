> | **Project Name**    | Phonics and Flashcards Project |
> |--------------------|---------------------------------|
> | **Status**         | ðŸ”„ Research Phase               |
> | **Target Audience** | Children aged 3-8 in Hong Kong |
> | **Setting**        | One-on-one home tutoring (60-90 mins) |
> | **Student Language Context** | Mainly bilingual (Cantonese-English) |


## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

**Primary Objective**: Develop an evidence-based, systematic approach to teaching phonics and reading through flashcards for young, mainly bilingual learners in Hong Kong.

**Specific Goals**:
1. Create a comprehensive flashcard system covering both decodable (phonics) and sight words
2. Establish clear progression pathways suitable for ages 3-8
3. Address specific challenges faced by Cantonese-speaking children learning English
4. Accommodate potential learning differences (including dyslexia)
5. Build materials that can later be digitised into a flashcard generator application

## ðŸ‘¥ Target Learner Profile

- **Age Range**: 3-8 years old
- **Language Background**: 
  - Largely bilingual households (Cantonese-English), with some
  - English may be primary or secondary language
  - Most use Cantonese at home (no Mandarin/Putonghua focus needed)
- **Learning Context**: 
  - One-on-one tutoring
  - Home settings
  - 60-90 minute sessions
- **Special Considerations**: 
  - Some learners may have dyslexia
  - Typically developing readers
  - Mixed English exposure levels

## ðŸ“‹ Project Scope & Requirements

### In Scope:
- [ ] Research best practices for phonics teaching methodologies
- [ ] Develop word lists (phonics-based and sight words)
- [ ] Create progression frameworks
- [ ] Design assessment and tracking methods
- [ ] Consider Cantonese L1 interference patterns
- [ ] Plan for future digital implementation

### Out of Scope:
- Mandarin/Putonghua considerations
- Group teaching strategies
- School curriculum alignment
- Immediate digital development

### Key Requirements:
- **Materials**: Physical flashcards (printable)
- **Data Structure**: Clean, code-interpretable organisation (JSON or similar)
- **Methodology**: Evidence-based, contemporary best practices
- **Flexibility**: Independent programme (not curriculum-bound)
- **Accessibility**: Suitable for potential dyslexic learners

## ðŸŽ“ Teaching Context

### Session Structure:
- **Duration**: 60-90 minutes
- **Format**: One-on-one
- **Location**: Children's homes
- **Materials Available**: 
  - A3 pad
  - Stationery
  - Levelled readers (Oxford Reading Tree)
  - Prepared games
  - Whiteboard (sometimes)

### Teaching Approach:
- Synthetic and/or analytic phonics (based on research findings)
- Progressive skill building (letters â†’ 2-letter words â†’ CVC â†’ complex patterns)
- Integration with levelled readers
- Balance of decoding practice and sight word recognition

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics (To Be Confirmed)

**Potential Metrics to Consider**:
1. **Progress Indicators**:
   - Number of phonics patterns mastered
   - Sight word recognition count by age
   - Progression through ORT reading levels
   - Time to achieve reading fluency milestones

2. **Assessment Measures**:
   - Decoding accuracy rates
   - Reading speed (words per minute)
   - Comprehension scores
   - Phonological awareness improvements

3. **Engagement Metrics**:
   - Session completion rates
   - Student confidence levels
   - Parent feedback scores
   - Time spent reading independently

4. **Learning Efficiency**:
   - Weeks to master each phonics phase
   - Retention rates after breaks
   - Transfer to untaught words
   - Error pattern improvements

*Note: Final metrics to be selected based on research findings and practical feasibility*

## ðŸš€ Current Phase: Research

### Completed:
- âœ… RD-001: [[EB Teaching Guide for Phonics and Reading to Bilingual Children in HK]]
- âœ… RD-002: [[Phonics Flashcard Guide for Cantonese-Speaking Children in HK]]
- âœ… Established project scope and parameters

### In Progress:
- ðŸ”„ Refining word lists and generation approaches
- ðŸ”„ Analysing sight words vs decodable words interaction
- ðŸ”„ Researching child spoken frequency considerations
- ðŸ”„ Investigating materials integration strategies

### Next Milestone:
**Word List Development** - Create comprehensive, organised word lists that:
- Balance phonics progression with sight word needs
- Account for child spoken frequency
- Integrate with available reading materials
- Address Cantonese L1 challenges systematically

## ðŸ”§ Technical Considerations

### Data Organisation Requirements:
- Clean, structured data format (JSON preferred)
- Clear categorisation system
- Version control friendly
- Easy to parse programmatically
- Scalable for future additions

### Future Application Potential:
- Flashcard generator functionality
- Progress tracking system
- Customisable card sets
- Print-ready outputs
- Assessment integration

## ðŸ“š Research Foundations

The project builds on contemporary reading science, with particular attention to:
- Synthetic phonics effectiveness for ESL learners
- Orthographic mapping principles
- Multisensory learning approaches
- Bilingual cognitive advantages
- Early intervention strategies
