# Project Context: Phonics and Flashcards Project

Before anything else, please switch to the "phonics-project" basic memory project, which is located at: /Users/noahscott/Documents/Basic Memory/phonics-project. If you cannot find it do let me know and we will locate it prior to anything further.

## ‚ö° Quick Reference
- **UK English** | **DD/MM/YYYY dates** | **24-hour time** | **Metric only**
- **Concise > Complete** | **Specific > Vague** | **Simple > Complex**
- **Verify facts** | **Cite sources** | **No imaginary data**

## Collaboration Principles
- **Discuss before editing**: Always review proposed changes together in chat before modifying any documents
- **Version control**: When updating existing documents, keep the original and create a new version for comparison
- **Start simple**: Begin with minimal structure, add complexity only when needed
- **Verify facts**: Flag anything that needs fact-checking rather than guessing
- **Conciseness matters**: Combine related points, avoid redundancy
- **10-second rule**: Document purpose must be clear within 10 seconds

## Project Overview
I'm developing an evidence-based phonics teaching system using flashcards for children aged 3-8 in Hong Kong. The project focuses on one-on-one tutoring in home settings (60-90 minute sessions) for bilingual children (Cantonese-English speakers).

## Current Project Status
- **Phase**: Content development and refinement
- **Completed Research**: 
  - RD-001: Teaching methodology guide (synthetic phonics approach chosen)
  - RD-002: Flashcard implementation guide (word lists and progressions)
  - RD-003: Systematic Phonics Sequencing Best Practices
- **Completed Resources**:
  - SATPIN Foundation Words v2 (WL-001) with 36 real words + 10 nonsense
  - JSON data structure for programmatic word list access
- **Current Focus**: Expanding word lists to next phonics groups and creating teaching materials

## Key Project Decisions Made
1. **Methodology**: Synthetic phonics (60%) with analytic support (30%)
2. **Progression**: SATPIN sequence ‚Üí UK Letters & Sounds phases
3. **Flashcard Specs**: 3"√ó5" cards, no pictures, black text on white
4. **Sight Words**: Using New Dolch List (875 words) for ESL learners
5. **Decodability Standard**: 80-90% decodable text for practice materials
6. **Word List Structure**: JSON format with patterns, tiers, and L1 challenges tracked

## Technical Context
- Using Basic Memory for knowledge management
- Documents organised in Obsidian-style markdown
- Project structure:
  - 00-project-overview/ (project briefs, templates, guides)
  - 01-research-foundation/ (research documents, resources, templates)
  - 01-research-foundation/resources/ (word lists and data)
  - 05-phonics/ (SATPIN and phonics materials)
- Data in clean JSON format for future applications
- Planning for future flashcard generator application

## Target Audience Specifics
- **Age**: 3-8 years old
- **Language**: Bilingual (Cantonese-English), no Mandarin focus needed
- **Setting**: Home tutoring, one-on-one
- **Challenges**: L1 interference from Cantonese (missing phonemes: /v/, /z/, /Œ∏/, /√∞/, /r/)
- **Special Considerations**: Some learners may have dyslexia

## Documentation Style & Quality Standards
- **Style Guide**: Follow [[memory://00-project-overview/ai-guides/project-style-guide]] for all documentation
- **Core principle**: Clarity beats completeness - be concise and specific
- **UK English**: Use UK spelling (recognise, prioritise, centre) and DD/MM/YYYY date format
- **Evidence-based**: Verify all facts, cite sources properly, no imaginary content
- **Action items**: Must be specific enough to delegate tomorrow

## Document Standards & Templates
- **Research docs**: External research, preserve original content, use [[memory://01-research-foundation/templates/research-doc-template]]
- **Resource docs**: Data/word lists, concise with practical focus, use [[memory://01-research-foundation/templates/resource-doc-template]]
- **General docs**: Internal project docs, minimal structure, use [[memory://01-research-foundation/templates/general-doc-template]]
- **Quality focus**: Every section must add value - if not, remove it
- **Memory features**: Use sparingly, only for major decisions and direct dependencies

## Current Priorities
1. Develop Group 1.2 word lists (c/k, e, h, r, m, d)
2. Create teaching sequence for blending SATPIN + Group 1.2
3. Design assessment rubrics for progress tracking
4. Build Cantonese-specific error correction materials
5. Create decodable reading passages using completed word lists

## At the end of the session
I will close the session manually and notify you (alternatively if we get close to context limits please notify me and we will close the session), at which point:
- Please provide any updates to this document that are needed, eg. any changes that would impact the 'Current Project Status' or 'Key Project Decisions Made' areas etc.
- And a commit message that I can use for backing up the project to gh

## üìù Usage Instructions

1. **Copy the content** between the dividers above
2. **Paste at the start** of your new Claude conversation
3. **Fill in the "What I Need Help With"** section with specifics for your session
4. **Add any additional context** specific to current work not captured in template
5. **Reference specific documents** if the task requires them

## üí° Tips for Effective Handovers

### DO:
- **Be specific** about what you need in the current session
- **State if you want comparison versions** when updating documents
- **Reference exact document paths** when working on specific files
- **Mention recent changes** not captured in the template
- **Include examples** of the output format you want

### DON'T:
- **Don't be vague** - "improve this" vs "make this more concise by combining related points"
- **Don't skip context** - Claude needs to know what stage you're at
- **Don't forget constraints** - mention deadlines, length limits, specific requirements
