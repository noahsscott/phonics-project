> [!important] Core Philosophy
> **Clarity beats completeness. Conciseness with precision is the goal.**
> 
> Every word should earn its place. If you can't explain why a section adds value, remove it.

## 🎯 Documentation Principles

### The Four Pillars
1. **EVIDENCE BASED**: Every fact must be verifiable. No imaginary content or wishful data. References required.
2. **Clarity**: A substitute teacher should understand it. No unnecessary jargon.
3. **Conciseness**: Say it once, say it well. Combine related points.
4. **Actionability**: Documentation should enable decisions and actions, not just record thoughts.

### The "10-Second Rule"
Anyone should understand a document's purpose within 10 seconds of opening it. If they can't, your scope is too broad or your purpose unclear.

## ✍️ Writing Standards

### Language & Tone
- **Use plain English**: "Why frequency matters" not "Frequency principle"
- **Be specific**: "315 words = 78% coverage" not "provides good coverage"
- **Active voice**: "Use synthetic phonics for 60% of time" not "It is recommended that synthetic phonics be utilised"
- **UK spelling**: Recognise, prioritise, organisation, centre

### Formatting Consistency
- **Dates**: DD/MM/YYYY format (09/08/2025)
- **Lists**: Maximum 5 items per list, combine if more needed
- **Sections**: 3-4 main sections ideal, 7+ is too many
- **Paragraphs**: 3-4 sentences maximum

## 🔍 Content Guidelines

### When Adding Information
Ask yourself:
1. Does this help someone make a decision?
2. Would removing it make the document less useful?
3. Is this the simplest way to explain it?
4. Am I repeating something said elsewhere?

If you answer "no" to any of these, reconsider.

### Combining Related Points
❌ **Don't separate what belongs together**:
- Coverage: Provides 90% coverage
- Modern: Updated for contemporary use
- ESL-friendly: Good for second language learners

✅ **Do combine related ideas**:
- **Modern coverage**: Provides 90% coverage of current texts (vs 70% for 1936 version)

### Evidence & Citations
- **Always cite sources**: (Author, Year) or (Author, Year, p.X)
- **Be specific**: "NICHD 2000, effect size d=0.41" not "research shows it's effective"
- **Verify facts**: If you can't verify it, mark it for fact-checking
- **No imaginary data**: Better to leave blank than invent

## 📊 Data & Resources

### Presenting Data
- **Context required**: "78% coverage = 8 out of 10 words recognised"
- **Practical implications**: What does this mean for the user?
- **Remove obvious notes**: Don't note "lower rank = more frequent"
- **Keep data separate**: Use embedded files, don't duplicate

### Resource Documentation
- Start with WHAT it is, then WHY it matters
- Maximum 3-4 sentences for descriptions
- Usage instructions must be actionable
- Limitations grouped, not listed separately

## 🎬 Action Items & Objectives

### Making Things Actionable
❌ **Poor action**: "Develop materials"
✅ **Good action**: "Create 10 CVC words for each SATPIN letter"

❌ **Poor objective**: "Understand phonics methods"
✅ **Good objective**: "Identify 3+ evidence-based phonics approaches for ESL"

### Delegation Test
Could you hand this action to someone else tomorrow? If not, it's not specific enough.

## 🔗 Document Relationships

### Memory Links - Use Sparingly
- Only link direct dependencies
- Mark planned documents as *(planned)*
- Don't create links for general references
- Maximum 4-5 related documents

### When to Use Memory Features
- **Major decisions only**: Platform choices, methodology selection
- **Direct dependencies**: Document A requires Document B
- **Not for**: General concepts, minor points, everything you mention

## ✅ Quality Checklist

Before finalising any document:
- [ ] **Purpose clear in one line?** If not, narrow scope
- [ ] **No redundancy between sections?** Combine or cut
- [ ] **Every statistic has context?** Add practical meaning
- [ ] **Actions specific enough to delegate?** Add detail
- [ ] **Removed all "nice to have" content?** Be ruthless
- [ ] **Would a newcomer understand?** Remove jargon
- [ ] **Facts verified or marked for checking?** No guessing

## 🚫 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### The Bloat Trap
Adding sections because a template has them, or for excessive use-case coverage, not because you need them.
**Solution**: Start minimal, add only when necessary.

### The Academic Voice
"It has been determined through extensive analysis that..."
**Solution**: "We found that..."

### The Kitchen Sink
Including everything possibly relevant.
**Solution**: Include only what enables action.

### The Imagination Fill
Making up data or details to fill sections.
**Solution**: Leave blank or mark as "TBD" with honesty.

### The Redundancy Loop
Saying the same thing in Overview, Key Points, and Main Content.
**Solution**: Say it once in the most appropriate place.

## 📐 Template Selection

Choose the right template:
- **Research Doc**: External research, literature reviews, evidence gathering
- **Resource Doc**: Data sets, word lists, reference materials
- **General Doc**: Everything else you create internally

When in doubt, use General Doc and keep it simple.

## 🎯 The Final Test

Before publishing, ask:
> "If I had to pay $10 per word, would I keep all of these?"

This mindset ensures every word earns its place.

## Quick Reference Card

### Essential Reminders
- **One concept** = One location (don't repeat)
- **Three bullets** > Seven bullets (combine related points)
- **Specific numbers** > Vague descriptions
- **Plain language** > Academic jargon
- **Verified facts** > Best guesses
- **Clear structure** > Complete coverage

### The Golden Rules
1. Perfect is the enemy of done
2. Start simple, add complexity only when needed
3. If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough
4. Documentation should enable action, not just record information

*This style guide is a living document but changes should maintain our commitment to clarity and conciseness. When in doubt, choose the simpler option.*
