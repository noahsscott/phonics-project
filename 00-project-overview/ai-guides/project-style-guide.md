> [!important] Core Philosophy
> **Evidence-based clarity beats everything. Conciseness with precision follows.**
> 
> Every word should earn its place through evidence or enablement. If you can't verify it or it doesn't enable action, remove it.

## 🎯 Documentation Principles

### The Four Pillars
1. **EVIDENCE BASED**: Every fact must be verifiable. No imaginary content or wishful data. References required.
2. **Clarity**: A substitute teacher should understand it. No unnecessary jargon.
3. **Conciseness**: Say it once, say it well. Combine related points.
4. **Actionability**: Documentation should enable decisions and actions, not just record thoughts.

### The "10-Second Rule"
Anyone should understand a document's purpose within 10 seconds of opening it. If they can't, your scope is too broad or your purpose unclear.

## 📑 Document Types & Numbering

- **RD-XXX**: Research documents (external evidence, literature reviews)
- **MAT-XXX**: Materials and activities (teaching resources, activities)
- **Resource docs**: Data, word lists, reference materials
- **Planning docs**: Development briefs, project plans
- **Assessment tools**: Tracking cards, checklists, rubrics
- **Crosswalk tools**: Navigation aids between stages, placement guides
- **General docs**: Everything else

## ✍️ Writing Standards

### Language & Tone
- **Use plain English**: "Why frequency matters" not "Frequency principle"
- **Be specific**: "315 words = 78% coverage" not "provides good coverage"
- **Active voice**: "Use synthetic phonics for 60% of time" not "It is recommended that synthetic phonics be utilised"
- **UK spelling**: Recognise, prioritise, organisation, centre

### Formatting Consistency
- **Dates**: DD/MM/YYYY format (09/08/2025)
- **Lists**: Maximum 5 items per list, combine if more needed
- **Sections**: 3-4 main sections ideal, 7+ is too many
- **Paragraphs**: 3-4 sentences maximum

### File & Folder Naming
- **Use kebab-case**: `phonics-progression-sequence.md`
- **No spaces or capitals**: `01-research-foundation` not `01 Research Foundation`
- **Sequential numbering**: `00-project-overview`, `01-research-foundation`
- **Decimal sub-stages**: `02.1-assessment`, `02.2-activities`

## 🔍 Content Guidelines

### When Adding Information
Ask yourself:
1. Does this help someone make a decision?
2. Would removing it make the document less useful?
3. Is this the simplest way to explain it?
4. Am I repeating something said elsewhere?
If you answer "no" to any of these, reconsider.

### Combining Related Points
❌ **Don't separate what belongs together**:
- Coverage: Provides 90% coverage
- Modern: Updated for contemporary use
- ESL-friendly: Good for second language learners

✅ **Do combine related ideas**:
- **Modern coverage**: Provides 90% coverage of current texts (vs 70% for 1936 version)

### Evidence & Citations
- **Always cite sources**: (Author, Year) or (Author, Year, p.X)
- **Be specific**: "NICHD 2000, effect size d=0.41" not "research shows it's effective"
- **Verify facts**: If you can't verify it, mark it for fact-checking
- **No imaginary data**: Better to leave blank than invent

## 📊 Data & Resources

### Presenting Data
- **Context required**: "78% coverage = 8 out of 10 words recognised"
- **Practical implications**: What does this mean for the user?
- **Remove obvious notes**: Don't note "lower rank = more frequent"
- **Keep data separate**: Use embedded files, don't duplicate

### Tables & Data Presentation
Research objectives table format:
| Objective | Success Criteria | Result | Evidence |
| --------- | --------------- | ------ | -------- |
| [Specific] | [Measurable] | ✅/⚠️/❌ | [Citation] |

Always include context: "90% accuracy = 9 out of 10 correct"

### Resource Documentation
- Start with WHAT it is, then WHY it matters
- Maximum 3-4 sentences for descriptions
- Usage instructions must be actionable
- Limitations grouped, not listed separately

## 🎬 Action Items & Objectives

### Making Things Actionable
❌ **Poor action**: "Develop materials"
✅ **Good action**: "Create 10 CVC words for each SATPIN letter"
✅ **Better**: "MAT-001: Phonics readiness checklist with traffic light system"

❌ **Poor objective**: "Understand phonics methods"
✅ **Good objective**: "Identify 3+ evidence-based phonics approaches for ESL"

### Delegation Test
Could you hand this action to someone else tomorrow? If not, it's not specific enough.

## 📈 Progress Tracking

### Exposure-Based Measurement
- **Count exposures, not time**: "5 exposures per stage" not "1 week of practice"
- **Flexible for schedules**: Works for 1x/week or daily attendance
- **Parent-friendly**: Explain why exposure-based tracking matters
- **Mastery focused**: 90% accuracy over 3 sessions, not calendar progression

### Status Indicators
- ✅ **Completed**: Finalised, ready for use
- 🔄 **In Progress**: Active development
- ⚠️ **Needs Review**: Complete but needs validation
- 🚧 **Under Review**: Being edited
- 🚀 **Ready to Execute**: Planned and resourced

## 🔗 Document Relationships

### Memory Links - Use Sparingly
- Only link direct dependencies
- Mark planned documents as *(planned)*
- Don't create links for general references
- Maximum 4-5 related documents

### When to Use Memory Features
- **Major decisions only**: Platform choices, methodology selection
- **Direct dependencies**: Document A requires Document B
- **Not for**: General concepts, minor points, everything you mention

## 📏 Document Length Guidelines

**Evidence determines length**: If evidence requires more words, use them. If not, cut them.

Target ranges (flex for evidence):
- **Project brief**: 500-700 words
- **Research summary**: 300-500 words (not including main research)
- **Material specification**: 200-300 words
- **Assessment tool**: 150-250 words
- **Parent guide**: 300-400 words
- **Planning document**: 400-600 words

Apply the "$10 per word" test after evidence requirements are met.

## 🎭 Audience Differentiation

State your primary audience in the first 10 seconds:
- **For tutors**: Practical how-to instructions, session structures
- **For parents**: Simple explanations, no jargon, clear expectations
- **For developers**: Technical specs, JSON formats, data structures
- **For assessment**: Clear rubrics, observable behaviours

## ✅ Quality Checklist

Before finalising any document:
- [ ] **Evidence for every claim?** Citations present and verified
- [ ] **Purpose clear in one line?** If not, narrow scope
- [ ] **No redundancy between sections?** Combine or cut
- [ ] **Every statistic has context?** Add practical meaning
- [ ] **Actions specific enough to delegate?** Add detail
- [ ] **Removed all "nice to have" content?** Be ruthless
- [ ] **Would a newcomer understand?** Remove jargon
- [ ] **Primary audience identified?** Adjust language accordingly

## 🚫 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### The Bloat Trap
Adding sections because a template has them, not because you need them.
**Solution**: Start minimal, add only when necessary.

### The Academic Voice
"It has been determined through extensive analysis that..."
**Solution**: "We found that..."

### The Kitchen Sink
Including everything possibly relevant.
**Solution**: Include only what enables action.

### The Imagination Fill
Making up data or details to fill sections.
**Solution**: Leave blank or mark as "TBD" with honesty.

### The Redundancy Loop
Saying the same thing in Overview, Key Points, and Main Content.
**Solution**: Say it once in the most appropriate place.

### The Week-Based Trap
Using time-based measures when attendance varies.
**Solution**: Use exposure-based tracking for flexibility.

## 📐 Template Selection

Choose the right template:
- **Research Doc**: External research, literature reviews, evidence gathering
- **Resource Doc**: Data sets, word lists, reference materials
- **General Doc**: Everything else you create internally

When in doubt, use General Doc and keep it simple.

## 🎯 The Final Test

Before publishing, ask:
> "Is every claim supported by evidence? Would I pay $10 per word for what remains?"

This dual test ensures credibility and conciseness.

## Quick Reference Card

### Essential Reminders
- **Evidence first** = No claim without citation
- **One concept** = One location (don't repeat)
- **Three bullets** > Seven bullets (combine related points)
- **Specific numbers** > Vague descriptions
- **Plain language** > Academic jargon
- **Verified facts** > Best guesses
- **Clear structure** > Complete coverage

### The Golden Rules
1. Evidence beats opinion every time
2. Perfect is the enemy of done
3. Start simple, add complexity only when needed
4. If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough
5. Documentation should enable action, not just record information

*This style guide is a living document but changes should maintain our commitment to evidence-based clarity and conciseness. When in doubt, choose the simpler, verifiable option.*
