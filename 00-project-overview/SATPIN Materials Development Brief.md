# üìã SATPIN Materials Development Brief: Hybrid Approach

## üéØ Project Goal
Develop and test a complete SATPIN teaching system with 2 pilot students before scaling to additional letter groups.

## üìä Development Phases

### Phase 1: Assessment & Tracking Tools (Weeks 1-2)
**Priority: HIGH** - Foundation for everything else

- **Student Progress Cards**: Individual tracking for 6 stages √ó 5 exposures
- **Assessment Recording Sheets**: Based on error matrix (reversals, final drops, blending, etc.)
- **Quick Placement Tool**: Determine student's starting stage
- **Parent Communication Template**: Explain stage-based progression vs traditional weeks

### Phase 2: Core Teaching Materials (Weeks 3-4)
**Priority: HIGH** - Following research specifications

- **Text-Only Flashcards**: 36 words + 10 nonsense words (3"√ó5", black on white, NO pictures)
- **Decodable Readers**: 6 mini-books matching each stage
  - Stage 1: Single words per page
  - Stages 2-6: Progressive sentences from the progression document
- **Multisensory Tools for Cantonese L1**:
  - Mirror cards for /n/, /t/, /s/ mouth positions
  - Tap cards for final consonant practice
  - Breath strips for aspiration training

### Phase 3: Pilot Testing (Weeks 5-6)
**Priority: HIGH** - Validate before scaling

- Test with 2 students across different schedules (e.g., 1x/week and 2x/week)
- Use tracking tools to monitor 5 exposures per stage
- Document which students need 6-7 exposures vs standard 5
- Collect parent feedback on system understanding
- Measure progress against 90% mastery criterion

### Phase 4: Refinement & Scaling (Weeks 7-8)
**Priority: MEDIUM** - After validation

- Adjust materials based on pilot data
- Create Group 1.2 materials (c/k, e, h, r, m, d) using validated format
- Develop home practice resources (no digital required initially)
- Build assessment library with multiple test sets

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Principles

1. **NO PICTURES** on flashcards (per research: prevents guessing, ensures decoding)
2. **Track exposures, not days** (flexible for varied schedules)
3. **90% mastery before progression** (3 consecutive successful exposures)
4. **Synthetic approach** (sounds ‚Üí words, not initial letter focus)

## üìà Success Metrics

- Students progress through stages based on mastery, not time
- Parents understand and can support the system
- 90%+ accuracy achieved before stage progression
- Tracking system captures individual learning patterns

## üö´ What We're NOT Doing

- Creating picture cards or "A is for Apple" materials
- Building complex digital tools initially
- Making materials for all letter groups before testing
- Using week-based scheduling

## ‚úÖ Minimum Viable Product for Testing

- 10 core CVC word cards
- 1 progress tracking sheet
- 1 stage-appropriate reader
- 1 parent guide
- 1 assessment checklist

## üìù Implementation Notes

### Next Actions
1. Create student progress tracking cards (6 stages √ó 5 exposures with date fields)
2. Design assessment recording sheet based on error matrix
3. Draft parent guide explaining stage-based vs week-based progression

### Testing Considerations
- Select 2 students with different attendance patterns
- One student attending 1x/week
- One student attending 2x/week
- Document adaptation needs for each schedule type

### Materials Specifications
Per research findings (RD-001, RD-002):
- Flashcards: 3"√ó5" minimum
- Font: Black text on white background
- No decorative elements that could distract
- Clear, sans-serif font (Arial or similar)
- Lowercase letters primarily
