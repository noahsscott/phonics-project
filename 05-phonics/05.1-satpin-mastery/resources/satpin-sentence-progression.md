## ðŸ”„ Flexible Review System

### Exposure-Based Progression
Each sentence set needs 5 exposures to reach mastery:

| Exposure | Purpose | Ideal Spacing | Success Target | Progress Tracking |
|----------|---------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **1st** | Introduction | First contact | Read with teacher support | â–¡ Date: ___ |
| **2nd** | Recognition | 1-2 days after 1st | 60% independent accuracy | â–¡ Date: ___ |
| **3rd** | Consolidation | 2-4 days after 2nd | 75% independent accuracy | â–¡ Date: ___ |
| **4th** | Fluency | 1 week after 1st | 85% accuracy with flow | â–¡ Date: ___ |
| **5th** | Maintenance | 3-4 weeks after 1st | 90%+ automatic reading | â–¡ Date: ___ |

*Note: Ideal spacing maximises retention, but any exposure helps. Track actual dates to monitor gaps. Some students may need 6-7 exposures.*

### Adapting for Different Schedules

**3x/week students**: Can follow ideal spacing closely
- Session 1: 1st exposure â†’ Session 2: 2nd â†’ Session 3: 3rd
- Session 4: 4th â†’ Session 12: 5th (maintenance)

**2x/week students**: Moderate spacing adjustments  
- Week 1: 1st exposure (Session 1), 2nd exposure (Session 2)
- Week 2: 3rd exposure (Session 3), 4th exposure (Session 4)
- Week 4: 5th exposure (maintenance check)

**1x/week students**: Multiple exposures per session
- Week 1: 1st and 2nd exposure (with 10-min break between)
- Week 2: 3rd exposure + introduce new content
- Week 3: 4th exposure + continue new content
- Week 6: 5th exposure (maintenance review)

*ESL Adjustment: Native speakers might handle 4-5 new sentences per exposure. Keep to 2-3 for ESL learners.*

## ðŸŽ¯ Teaching Tips for Sentences

### Progression Principles
1. **Pre-week foundation** - Single words only
2. **Start with 2-word phrases** - Build confidence gradually
3. **Add one complexity at a time** - Either length OR new pattern
4. **Maintain high success rate** - 90% accuracy before progression

### Scaffolding Strategies
| Challenge | Support Strategy |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Can't blend smoothly | Teacher reads first, student echoes |
| Loses place | Point to each word, use finger tracking |
| Forgets earlier words | Reread from beginning each time |
| No comprehension | Act out sentences with gestures |
| Struggles with names | Explain Pat/Nan are just CVC patterns |

### Error Correction Protocol
1. **Student reads**: "Pat sit" (missing -s)
2. **Teacher prompts**: "Let's check the ending. What letter is at the end?"
3. **Student self-corrects**: "Pat sits"
4. **Reread entire sentence**: For fluency

## ðŸ“Š Progressive Complexity Analysis

| Stage | Words per Sentence | New Elements | ESL Pacing |
|-------|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| Pre | 1 word | Single word recognition | 3-5 days |
| 0.5 | 2-3 words | First phrases | 3-4 days |
| Week 1 | 2-5 words | VC sentences | 7 days |
| Week 2 | 2-6 words | CVC + names | 7 days |
| Week 3 | 3-7 words | Extended CVC | 7 days |
| Week 4 | 4-8 words | Blends, plurals | 7 days |

## ðŸ’¡ Differentiation Options

### Support Level
- Read only underlined words: "Pat **sat** in **it**."
- Complete the sentence: "Pat sat in a ___."
- Match sentence to picture
- Echo reading with teacher

### Core Level
- Read all sentences independently
- Answer yes/no questions: "Is Pat in a pan?"
- Draw what the sentence says
- Read with expression

### Extension Level
- Create own SATPIN sentences
- Change one word: "Pat sat" â†’ "Nan sat"
- Combine sentences: "Pat sat. + Pat naps." â†’ "Pat sat and naps."
- Write sentences from dictation
- Use unused words: Create sentences with 'asp' and 'pint'

## ðŸŽŒ Cantonese L1 Considerations

### Common Sentence-Level Errors
1. **Dropping "is"**: "It in" instead of "It is in"
   - Practice: Emphasise linking verb, tap for each word
   
2. **Final -s omission**: "Pat sit" instead of "Pat sits"
   - Practice: Over-articulate endings, use hand signal
   
3. **Article confusion**: "In tin" instead of "In a tin"
   - Practice: Count words before reading

4. **Name pronunciation**: "Pat" may sound like "Pet"
   - Practice: Open /Ã¦/ sound with mirror work

### Cultural Adaptations
- Names chosen for CVC pattern, not cultural familiarity
- Avoid idioms or cultural expressions
- Focus on concrete, visible actions

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Assessment Rubric

| Skill | Mastery = 90% | Developing = 70% | Needs Support < 70% |
|-------|---------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Accuracy** | 9/10 words correct | 7/10 words correct | Fewer than 7/10 |
| **Fluency** | Natural phrasing | Word-by-word | Sound-by-sound |
| **Comprehension** | Can illustrate meaning | Understands with help | No understanding |
| **Expression** | Reads with meaning | Monotone but accurate | Struggles throughout |

*Assess after Exposure 3 (Consolidation) and Exposure 4 (Fluency Check). Progress only when 90% mastery achieved. Add extra exposures if needed before moving to new content.*
