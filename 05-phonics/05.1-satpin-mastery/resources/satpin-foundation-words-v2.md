## 📚 Prerequisites
Student should demonstrate:
- Recognition of letter shapes (s, a, t, p, i, n)
- Ability to name letters when shown
- Basic pencil grip for writing practice
- Attention span of 5+ minutes for focused work


## 📋 Progression Roadmap
Native L1 speakers typically learn 4-5 letters/week. This ESL-adjusted pace of 2-3 letters per stage allows for deeper phoneme awareness work.

| Stage | Pattern        | Mastery Gate                      |
| ----- | -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **1** | Single words   | Recognise "at", "it", "in"        |
| **2** | First phrases  | Read "at it", "is at" smoothly    |
| **3** | VC patterns    | Automatic recognition < 2 sec     |
| **4** | CVC core       | Read "sat, pin, sit" fluently     |
| **5** | CVC extended   | 90% accuracy all CVC              |
| **6** | Blends/plurals | Read 4-phoneme without segmenting |


## 🔄 Flexible Review System
Based on optimal retention research. Adjust individual exposure frequency based on student performance. Ideal spacing maximises retention, but any exposure helps. Track actual dates to monitor gaps. Some students may need 6-7 exposures.

| Exposure | Purpose       | Ideal Spacing       | Success Target        |
| -------- | ------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| **1st**  | Introduction  | First contact       | Introduce 5-7 cards   |
| **2nd**  | Recognition   | 1-2 days after 1st  | 60% accuracy expected |
| **3rd**  | Consolidation | 2-4 days after 2nd  | 75% accuracy expected |
| **4th**  | Fluency       | 1 week after 1st    | 85% accuracy expected |
| **5th**  | Maintenance   | 3-4 weeks after 1st | 90%+ for progression  |

## 🎯 Cantonese L1 Teaching Strategies
Note: These are preventative strategies to implement from lesson one, not error corrections.

| Common Challenge           | Prevention Strategy                                    |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Final /n/ dropping**     | Pre-teach with exaggerated ending + hand tap         |
| **Final /t/ unreleased**   | Practice aspiration with paper strips from start     |
| **Initial /s/ position**   | Mirror work for tongue placement before teaching     |
| **Vowel length confusion** | Use hand stretching for short /ɪ/ vs long sounds   |



## 📝 Application Sentences
All sentences are 100% decodable using only SATPIN letters, meeting the 80-90% decodability standard for early readers.

| Stage | Sentence Examples                     | Teaching Focus           | Decodability |
|-------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| **1** | "at", "it", "in"                      | Single word recognition  | 100%         |
| **2** | "at it", "in it", "is at"            | 2-3 word phrases        | 100%         |
| **3** | "It is at an inn."                   | Simple sentences        | 100%         |

| **6** | "Ants snap at pins in tins."        | Blends and plurals      | 100%         |


## 💡 Assessment & Error Matrix
90% mastery criterion: Progress to next stage only after achieving 90% accuracy across 3 consecutive exposures.

| Error Type        | Test Words              | Pass Criteria       | If Failed → Intervention         |
|------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Reversals**     | in/ni, is/si mixed      | 5/6 correct        | Letter orientation drills        |
| **Final drops**   | tap/ta, pin/pi pairs    | Says all endings   | Tap table for final sound       |
| **Final /n/**     | pant, ants, as          | Clear endings      | Over-articulate with hand signal |
| **Blending**      | 10 CVC words            | < 10 seconds total | Continuous sound practice        |
| **Encoding**      | Dictate: sat, pin, ant  | 4/5 spelled right  | Sound boxes practice            |
